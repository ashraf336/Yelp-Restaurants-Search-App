# Yelp-Restaurants-Search-React Native App 
This a simple React Native app that I implemented from the steven grider course on Udemy.

The app contains a search bar that takes a search word from the user and uses the YELP API to search for resataurants that contains that particular keyword or something similar to it.

Additionaly, the results that the API returns in a JSON object are then filtered according to the Price category of that result.

The results are presented in a horizantally scrollable TouchableOpacity List  where a user can  click on one of the restaurants.

Once the user chooses a restaurant , the user is navigated to  screen containing photos of the restaurant that had been fetched using the id registerded from the user choosen reataurant in the previous screen.

The followig are 6 screenshots from the App:
